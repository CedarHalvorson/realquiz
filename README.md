i added 5 buttons in html that i was able to reassign in js according to my array containing all of my questions and answers when you answer correctly. 
i also added a timer and when you click the wrong question it goes down -5 extra seconds in time and when it hits zero the timer stops.
when you reach the end of the game you're also presented with a game over screen.
